Note:

To use NVIDIA graphics card install the nvidia-docker2 by following the instructions in the Setting up NVIDIA Container ToolkitÂ¶ section of the following link

https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html 

The changes for NVIDIA graphic cards were done by updating the DOCKER and docker-compose.yaml by following the instructions on the link given below. You must do this before buidling the image and no need to add the bash script. It is already taken care of in the .yml file
